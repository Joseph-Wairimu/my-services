# description
This project aim at designing a website for customer service to enable fast services for customers.
## Design

Our design practice offers a full range of services including, interaction and visual design and user experience testing. Throughout our project, we create and implement visual design and workflows, solicit user feedback and work to make sure what gets built is what is needed.
## Product Management

Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly coding and testing, the product we build is always ready to go live. This iterative process allows for changes as business requirements evolve.
